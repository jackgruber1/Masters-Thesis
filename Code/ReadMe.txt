Contains the code for every year the analysis was done. 
If you correct the add data to your directory and correct the directory in the code, the file will produce all results. 

My coding skills were not very advanced when at the time this was produced; perhaps it would be prudents to wrap many of these commands into functions.
Furthermore, one script per year is not the way to go.
Nvertheless, the code does work and could be of use as a guide on how to use the functions in the iGraph package. 
Good luck!
